## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.1.0
* macOS-latest (4.1) on Github Actions
* windows-latest (4.1) on Github Actions
* ubuntu 18.04 (devel,4.1,4.0,3.6,3.5) on Github Actions

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## CRAN Policy issues
* One helper function, save_report() writes a pdf file to the userâ€™s file system, but it requires permission from the user in an interactive R session
* The examples are slow, because in order to demonstrate the usage of most of the functions, a model has to be run. Therefore, I wrapped them in \donttest{}. Checking time without the examples is well under 10 minutes, around 5 minutes on my machine.
