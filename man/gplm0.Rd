\usage{
gplm0(
  formula,
  data,
  c_param = NULL,
  h_max = NULL,
  parallel = TRUE,
  num_cores = NULL,
  forcepoint = rep(FALSE, nrow(data)),
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class "formula", with discharge column name as response and stage column name as a covariate, i.e. of the form \code{y} ~ \code{x} where \code{y} is discharge in m\eqn{^3/}s and \code{x} is stage in m (the data must be in the correct units). To include discharge measurement-error data, use the form \code{y | y_error ~ x}, where \code{y_error} is the column name for discharge measurement errors.}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing the variables specified in formula.}

\item{c_param}{The largest stage value for which there is zero discharge. If NULL (default), it is treated as unknown in the model and inferred from the data.}

\item{h_max}{The maximum stage to which the rating curve should extrapolate to. If NULL (default), the maximum stage value in the data is selected as an upper bound.}

\item{parallel}{A logical value indicating whether to run the MCMC in parallel or not. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{num_cores}{An integer between 1 and 4 (number of MCMC chains) indicating how many cores to use. Only used if parallel=TRUE. If NULL, the number of cores available on the device is detected automatically.}

\item{forcepoint}{A logical vector of the same length as the number of rows in data. If an element at index \eqn{i} is TRUE it indicates that the rating curve should be forced through the \eqn{i}-th measurement. Use with care, as this will strongly influence the resulting rating curve.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print progress and diagnostic information. If `TRUE`, the function will print messages as it runs. If `FALSE`, the function will run silently. Default is `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
gplm0 returns an object of class "gplm0". An object of class "gplm0" is a list containing the following components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{posterior}}{A list containing the full posterior samples for various parameters and derived quantities.}
  \item{\code{summary}}{A list containing summary statistics (2.5\%, 50\%, 97.5\% percentiles) for various parameters and derived quantities.}
  \item{\code{log_likelihood}}{A list containing log-likelihood related quantities including WAIC and DIC.}
  \item{\code{diagnostics}}{A list containing MCMC diagnostics including autocorrelation and acceptance rate.}
  \item{\code{formula}}{The formula provided by the user.}
  \item{\code{data}}{The data provided by the user, ordered by stage.}
  \item{\code{run_info}}{Information about the input arguments and specific parameters used in the MCMC chain.}
}
When discharge measurement-error data is included, the posterior and summary components also include Q_true (the estimated true discharge observations).
}
\description{
gplm0 is used to fit a discharge rating curve for paired measurements of stage and discharge using a generalized power-law model with a constant log-error variance as described in Hrafnkelsson et al. (2022). It also supports discharge measurement-error data. See "Details" for a more in depth description of the model.

\details{
The generalized power-law model is of the form
\deqn{Q=a(h-c)^{f(h)}}
where \eqn{Q} is discharge, \eqn{h} is stage, \eqn{a} and \eqn{c} are unknown constants and \eqn{f} is a function of \eqn{h}, referred to as the generalized power-law exponent.\cr\cr
The generalized power-law model is here inferred by using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The function \eqn{f} is modeled at the latent level as a fixed constant \eqn{b} plus a continuous stochastic process, \eqn{\beta(h)}, which is assumed to be twice differentiable. The model is on a logarithmic scale
\deqn{\log(Q_i) = \mu_i + \varepsilon_i\hspace{20mm}}
\deqn{\hspace{24mm}\mu_i = \log(a) + (b + \beta(h_i)) \log(h_i - c)}
for \eqn{i = 1,...,n}, where \eqn{\varepsilon_i} follows a normal distribution with mean zero and constant variance \eqn{\sigma_\varepsilon^2}. The stochastic process \eqn{\beta(h)} is assumed a priori to be a Gaussian process governed by a Matern covariance function with smoothness parameter \eqn{\nu = 2.5}.\cr\cr
When measurement error is included, the model accounts for the uncertainty in the discharge measurements, and \eqn{\sigma_\varepsilon^2} captures the remaining structural uncertainty. The measurement-error datum \eqn{Q_{\text{SE},i}} corresponding to an observed discharge \eqn{Q_{\text{OBS},i}} is assumed to be the standard deviation of a log-normal distribution with median value at the true observations, \eqn{Q_{\text{TRUE},i}}. Then the model can be summarized as
\deqn{\log(Q_{\text{OBS},i})\sim \mathcal{N}(\log(Q_{\text{TRUE},i}),\tau^2_i),}
\deqn{\log(Q_{\text{TRUE},i})\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\sigma_\varepsilon^2),\hspace{10mm}}
where \eqn{\tau^2_i} is the variance of the normal distribution corresponding to the measurement-error datum \eqn{Q_{\text{SE},i}}, which can be estimated as \eqn{\hat{\tau}^2_i=\log(1+(Q_{\text{SE},i}/Q_{\text{OBS},i})^2)}.
Both numerical and categorical measurement-error data are supported:\cr
\itemize{
  \item Numerical data: Direct standard deviation values of the measurement error, \eqn{Q_{\text{SE}}}.
  \item Categorical data: USGS discharge measurement quality codes, which are automatically transformed into numerical \eqn{Q_{\text{SE}}} values as follows:
    \itemize{
      \item E (Excellent): Within 2\% of the actual flow
      \item G (Good): Within 5\% of the actual flow
      \item F (Fair): Within 8\% of the actual flow
      \item P (Poor): Greater than 8\% of the actual flow
    }
}
An efficient posterior simulation is achieved by sampling from the joint posterior density of the hyperparameters of the model, and then sampling from the density of the latent parameters conditional on the hyperparameters.\cr\cr
Bayesian inference is based on the posterior density and summary statistics such as the posterior mean and 95\% posterior intervals are based on the posterior density. Analytical formulas for these summary statistics are intractable in most cases and thus they are computed by generating samples from the posterior density using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.
