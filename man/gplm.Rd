\usage{
gplm(
  formula,
  data,
  c_param = NULL,
  h_max = NULL,
  parallel = TRUE,
  num_cores = NULL,
  forcepoint = rep(FALSE, nrow(data))

}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class "formula", with discharge column name as response and stage column name as a covariate, i.e. of the form \code{y}~\code{x} where \code{y} is discharge in m\eqn{^3/}s and \code{x} is stage in m (it is very important that the data is in the correct units).}

\item{data}{data.frame containing the variables specified in formula.}

\item{c_param}{stage for which there is zero discharge. If NULL, it is treated as unknown in the model and inferred from the data.}

\item{h_max}{maximum stage to which the rating curve should extrapolate to. If NULL, the maximum stage value in the data is selected as an upper bound.}

\item{parallel}{logical value indicating whether to run the MCMC in parallel or not. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{num_cores}{integer between 1 and 4 (number of MCMC chains) indicating how many cores to use. Only used if parallel=TRUE. If NULL, the number of cores available on the device is detected automatically.}

\item{forcepoint}{logical vector of the same length as the number of rows in data. If an element at index \eqn{i} is TRUE it indicates that the rating curve should be forced through the \eqn{i}-th measurement. Use with care, as this will strongly influence the resulting rating curve.}

\description{
gplm is used to fit a discharge rating curve for paired measurements of stage and discharge using a generalized power-law model with variance that varies with stage as described in Hrafnkelsson et al. (2022).  See "Details" for a more elaborate description of the model.
}
\details{
The generalized power-law model is of the form
\deqn{Q=a(h-c)^{f(h)}}
where \eqn{Q} is discharge, \eqn{h} is stage, \eqn{a} and \eqn{c} are unknown constants and \eqn{f} is a function of \eqn{h}, referred to as the generalized power-law exponent.\cr\cr
The generalized power-law model is here inferred by using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The function \eqn{f} is modeled at the latent level as a fixed constant \eqn{b} plus a continuous stochastic process, \eqn{\beta(h)}, which is assumed to be twice differentiable. The model is on a logarithmic scale
\deqn{\log(Q_i) = \log(a) + (b + \beta(h_i)) \log(h_i - c) + \varepsilon_i,     i = 1,...,n}
where \eqn{\varepsilon_i} follows a normal distribution with mean zero and variance \eqn{\sigma_\varepsilon(h_i)^2} that varies with stage. The stochastic process \eqn{\beta(h)} is assumed a priori to be a Gaussian process governed by a Matern covariance function with smoothness parameter \eqn{\nu = 2.5}. The error variance, \eqn{\sigma_\varepsilon^2(h)}, of the log-discharge data  is modeled as an exponential of a B-spline curve, that is, a linear combination of six B-spline basis functions that are defined over the range of the stage observations. An efficient posterior simulation is achieved by sampling from the joint posterior density of the hyperparameters of the model, and then sampling from the density of the latent parameters conditional on the hyperparameters.\cr\cr
Bayesian inference is based on the posterior density and summary statistics such as the posterior mean and 95\% posterior intervals are based on the posterior density. Analytical formulas for these summary statistics are intractable in most cases and thus they are computed by generating samples from the posterior density using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.
