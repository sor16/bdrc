The `bdrc` package provides tools for fitting discharge rating curves using Bayesian hierarchical models. It implements both the classical power-law and the novel generalized power-law models, offering flexibility in handling various hydrological scenarios.

This package implements four models as described in Hrafnkelsson et al. (2022):

* ```plm0() ``` - Power-law model with constant log-error variance.  

* ```plm() ``` - Power-law model with stage-dependent log-error variance.  

* ```gplm0() ``` - Generalized power-law model with constant log-error variance.  

* ```gplm() ``` - Generalized power-law model with stage-dependent log-error variance.  

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("bdrc")
# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("sor16/bdrc")
```

## Usage

Fitting a discharge rating curve with bdrc is straightforward:

```{r,eval=F}
library(bdrc)
data(krokfors)
gplm.fit <- gplm(Q ~ W, krokfors)
summary(gplm.fit)
plot(gplm.fit)
```

## Key-features

* Easy-to-use interface for fitting Bayesian discharge rating curves
* Features the novel Generalized power-law rating curve model (Hrafnkelsson et al., 2022)
* Multiple model options to suit different hydrological scenarios
* Built-in visualization tools for model results and diagnostics 
* Integrates R and C++ for efficient MCMC sampling with parallel processing
